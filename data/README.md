We consider the daily player level gaming information from a popular MMORPG wherein the players use avatars to play the game. There are 5,188 players in our database observed over 30 days. For each player the data hold a host of time dependent covariates that are generated through the game-play and include current level of the game, number of friends, daily game time while playing player versus player mode, number of missions a player accomplished daily, etc. Additionally, the data also hold time varying guild characteristics for K = 50 guilds that the players have been part of in those 30 days.

The primary data is proprietary and not available online. However, for scientific analysis and research, the data can be requested from the following individuals, who are also the co-authors of this paper: Peng Liu (pliu2@scu.edu) and Hai Che (xxx). To request the data that has been used in this paper, an email must be sent to the aforementioned individuals from an institutional email id.
