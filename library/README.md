# Description

This folder holds the main R functions that all other scripts call. There are four scripts here and two of those are C++ scripts that are called from R.

1. `rcodelib_stableplayer.R` - this script holds several functions that implement the `CREJM variable selection algorithm`.

2. `codelib.cpp` - these are several `C++ functions` that are called by `rcodelib_stableplayer.R`.
